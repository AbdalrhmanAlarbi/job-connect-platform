# Job-Connect Project Instructions

## 1. Prerequisites
- PHP 8.1 or higher
- MySQL / MariaDB
- Apache with mod_rewrite enabled

## 2. Database Setup
1. Create a database named `job_connect` in your MySQL server (via phpMyAdmin or command line).
2. Create the database user (required):
   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'jobuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'TestPass!2025';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON job_connect.* TO 'jobuser'@'localhost';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```
3. Import the provided `database.sql` file into the `job_connect` database.
   - File contains: 10 tables with 6000+ records including users, companies, jobs, and applications
4. Configuration is already set in `app/Config/Database.php`:
   - Hostname: localhost
   - Username: jobuser
   - Password: TestPass!2025
   - Database: job_connect
   
   *Note: These credentials are pre-configured. Only modify if using different database credentials.*

## 3. How to Run
1. Place the project folder in your web server's root (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
2. Access the project via: `http://localhost/job-connect/`
   - *Note: The project automatically redirects to the `public/` folder for security.*

## 4. Admin Credentials
- **URL**: `http://localhost/job-connect/auth/login`
- **Email**: admin@libyanjobs.com
- **Password**: admin123

## 5. Important Note
The `vendor` folder is included and is required for the project to function. Do not delete it.
